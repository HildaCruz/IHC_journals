On january 26th I assisted an event (organized by Interaction Design) focused on UX/UI designing. 
What I experienced was an amazing evening with people who studied different careers and have 
experienced many things in their professional lives, yet all of them are still very eager to learn 
from each other what the other one knows about UX. 
What I realised, from what we discussed that evening, was that learning how to design a good UX 
is never enough, users will always be constantly evolutioning, from generations to generations 
that’s how it’s been and will be.
I don’t think there’ll be a moment when we manage to design a perfect UX/UI as our nature is 
meant to make mistakes over and over again and if it does, then most projects might have a wider 
percentage of succeed but not on a 100% scale; because no matter what happens, no person is exactly 
the same and our nature is meant to make mistakes over and over again.
