We discussed in class how a design may produce different emotions on a user.
I found an article that focused on human emotions in user experience and how to 
produce/capture it.
Emotions arenâ€™t static; there is a wide range of multiple emotions from where you may 
manifest not only one, but many in fact at the same time.
There are many research papers of UX generated emotions when testing, but it seems that 
there are only a few research papers on how to make a human take action onto something 
due to an emotion provoked by the system that is being tested. Music, pictures, video, 
and even textures are methods oddly combined with a user interface, it would be really 
interesting to produce a software that gets you motivated in a more natural way, rather 
than just being a screen you touch or a button you push.
