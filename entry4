At class we watched a TED* talk about how designing is about the details in who the user is 
and what he/she does everyday.
It is really interesting how our most primitive cognitive instincts manifest on a daily basis, 
and how meaningful a simple gesture such as holding a patient’s hand could be. Most impressive 
is the fact that missing this kind of tiny user actions can deeply impact your design.
When studying users and trying to understand their lives, standing in someone’s shoes isn’t 
enough as a solution; living with them isn’t either. There is no perfect method and there might 
never be one, because our cognitive complexity is so huge, there will always be a user we won’t be 
able to see in our scenarios until the product is released.
We must not then stay with a single studying method. Even if there’ll always be a gap in the 
user’s profile data, we might find new data form a different perspective of our users, that not 
all methods may provide.
