Cultural ergonomics.
The article* I read presented a case study with German and Vietnamese users to explore how 
cultural theory can be applied in early design phases to support culturally sensitive design.
Country-specific preferences and cultural habits applied in user interface designing are high 
time-consumer tasks. Nowadays understanding ergonomic human factors just isn’t enough. 
When designing, we must place first what the user needs, such as the emotional state, 
prior experiences, expectations, age, gender, and culture; and THEN, we can finally 
concentrate on a clickable and usable design. 
It appears that researchers have still not found an effective way on how to properly 
apply cultural theory in HCI, however, since cultural behaviour is highly ambiguous in each person, 
I don’t think there is an effective way to do it. I believe, that by understanding first how the cultural 
scope may affect your project you can now structure your limitations, designing what to do and what not to do.
